# Hi, I'm Matthieu Gilliéron! 👋

🎓 **Student at 42 Lausanne since October 1, 2024**, I chose this school for its unique and innovative curriculum.  
Its educational model is based on:  
- **Project-based learning**,  
- **Self-directed learning**,  
- **Peer-to-peer evaluation**.  

For me, this approach is excellent for developing my skills quickly, efficiently, and autonomously. It also enables me to adapt easily to the fast-evolving tech industry.


## 🌟 My Passions  

**🔧 Mechanics**  
Since I was young, I've been passionate about mechanics, enjoying the combination of hands-on work and logical thinking.  

**🏋️‍♂️ Sports**  
As a big fan of sports, I'm motivated by the idea of constant self-improvement. Sports help me maintain a balance between physical and mental well-being.  

**📚 Reading**  
Recently, I’ve developed a passion for reading, particularly autobiographies. They offer me valuable insights and shortcuts for my personal growth, helping me avoid certain mistakes and stay motivated.  

**💻 Programming**  
Of course, programming plays a major role in my life. I love tackling challenges and finding elegant solutions to a variety of problems. It’s a field where I can combine creativity with problem-solving.
